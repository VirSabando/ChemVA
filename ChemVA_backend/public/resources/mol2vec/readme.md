## NOTE ##

ChemVA employs Mol2Vec embeddings, proposed by [Jaeger et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00616)
The pretrained model here available can also be found in the [author's Mol2Vec GitHub repository](https://github.com/samoturk/mol2vec)

We hereby declare we do not own or have created Mol2Vec or any of its parts. Please refer to the original Mol2Vec paper for further details on the technique. Further details on Mol2Vec usage in ChemVA's development can be found in [our full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13150)
