## NOTE ##

ChemVA employs Mol2Vec embeddings, proposed by [Jaeger et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00616). The pretrained model here available was originally retrieved from the [author's Mol2Vec GitHub repository](https://github.com/samoturk/mol2vec).

We hereby declare **we do not own nor we have contributed to the creation of Mol2Vec or any of its parts**. Please refer to the original [Mol2Vec paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00616) for more details on the technique. Further details on Mol2Vec's usage in ChemVA can be found in [our full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13150).
